# Homework Bootstrap
Goals: Gain hands-on experience in Bootstrap to be prepared for developing your Client Project UI. 

Based on Bootstrap introduction in Lab, complete the following assignment.  You are to build a web application, using Bootstrap, with 3 pages – topic of your choice. **You may not** use your Capstone project, another group’s Capstone project, or the system used in the homework project. 

# Requirements: 
1. **Login Page**
 - Design a page with two textboxes and a button. The textboxes should be labeled username and password respectively. Label the button accordingly. 
 - If user enters any sort of text, redirect to home/index page. 
 - If text is not entered, display an error message.  
2.  **Home/Index Page**
 - Design a simple home page that will welcome your user and describe your project. 
3. **About You Page** 
 - Design a page that asks a user for: First and last name, address, city, state, zip, email, birthday, and phone number and provide a text area for them to enter their comments and or questions. When they click a submit button, just show an alert or some text saying if the submission was successful or not (you don’t have to really do anything with the text; if successful clear the textboxes and text area). 
 - Remember to use the real estate of the webpage.   UI needs to be aesthically pleasing - not just fields down the middle of the page.  Think about websites that you use regularly and how they are structured.
 - Validation should occur to check if all fields have something entered. Check for valid dates, emails, zip code and phone number. 

## Keep in Mind:
1.	Must have site-wide navigation. You can do it along the top, or on the side. Keep in mind you may add onto the navigation in later assignments. 
2.	Must have a header and a footer. 
3.	Try to incorporate a Temple Logo or Temple ‘T’ as a “brand” in your navigation bar or footer. 
4.	You must use Master/Content pages, remember the advantages you discovered in Individual Assignment 3.
